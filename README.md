# The second and third part of the Rock papers scissors game.

## The second part of the Rock papers scissors game.

For the application to work properly, You need to install docker-engine (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
After the engine is installed and reposotory is downloaded, You need to open a new terminal and run command `docker-compose up`. 
You need to wait for about 30 sec. for the database to start functioning.

Now you are done with Part 2.

## The third part of the Rock papers scissors game.

Now You need to open a new terminal and run these two commands in terminal. 
First run `npm install` and then run `npm run start:nodemon`.

After the commands are run, on this link (http://localhost:3004/)
You should see the text `Application works!`.

There may be a situation that the terminal where You run the command `npm run start:nodemon`, is showing an error. Probably that is because the database is not running yet, then You need to kill the terminal, open a new terminal, run the command `npm run start:nodemon`, and refresh the browser.

Now You are fully ready to test my homework.

To know more about this homework, please follow the instructions in the first part: (https://github.com/ArvidsRozitis/18-MD-Simple-RPS-game)
